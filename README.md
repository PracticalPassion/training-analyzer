# fitness analyzer


This app analyzes your training progress and shows the time spent within a certain period of time for different types of training and shows the time spent in defined zones. Of course, this is still very simple, but work is in progress here. In addition, direct access to the Apple Health Kit is not currently planned, as it simplifies development. The data is retrieved from the Apple Health Export XML file.
